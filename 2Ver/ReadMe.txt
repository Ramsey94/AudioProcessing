Description

This is a software tool designed with the aim of removing silences inside recording files, 
and extract features about reading time and time saved to listener after removing silences.

How to use
To use this app, simply open the Analyzer.exe file and select a folder which contains the 
".Mp3" files you want to analyze. Next step is to select output folder (Note: this software 
creates automaticly a folder named according a "MM-DD-YYYY-HH-mm-ss" format).
Now you can press the Analyze button to remove silences. This step may take some time 
deppending on the size and amount of files contained in the folder.
Finally you can generate an Excel file with the summary of the analyzis which will be also 
exported to the output folder selected.

Click exit to close program.
