Description

This is a software tool designed to remove silences inside recording files, 
and extract features about reading time and time saved to the listener after removing silences.

How to use
To use this app, simply open the Analyzer.exe file and select a folder that contains the 
".Mp3" files you want to analyze. The next step is to select the output folder (Note: this software 
automatically creates automatically a folder named according to an "MM-DD-YYYY-HH-mm-ss" format).
Now you can press the Analyze button to remove silences. This step may take some time 
depending on the size and amount of files contained in the folder.
Finally, you can generate an Excel file with the summary of the analysis which will be also 
exported to the output folder selected.

Click exit to close the program.
 

Features

* This app is powered by an FFMPEG audio converter which first converts Mp3 to WAV files to be 
  analyzed

* Removes unwanted silences that may be present at the beginning and end of the audio files by 
  recognizing human voices from background

* Automatically remove silences from an entire set of recordings in a few clicks

Limitations

* Long silences in between the recordings are not removed

* App may present errors since its the first commercial version launched and needs to be tested 
  in real scenarios to perform improvements

Future Improvements

* Remove silences in the middle of speech longer than the 30s

* Remove the black console appearing when using FFMPEG to convert file formats

* Receive existing Excel files to automatically add data to an existing database.
